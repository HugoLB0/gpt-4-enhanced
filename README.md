## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
### file structure:
- ``` MAIN_FLASK.py ``` is the main script that act as a backend. it handle the requests, Yolo and so on. 
- ``` MAIN_user_cli_gpt.py ``` is the command line version of the client, without the tts and stt feature.
- ``` MAIN_user_speech_reco.py ``` is the client with the stt and tts feature.

### how to run ?
First you have to put your OPENAI_APIKEY in the .env file with the following format:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-********"
```
Then install required modules (i recommande setting up a virtual environement first):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now, run the ``` MAIN_flask.py```, and in another terminal window, run the ``` MAIN_user_cli_gpt.py ``` or ``` MAIN_user_speech_reco.py ```, depending if you want tts and stt feature or not.
```
python MAIN_flask.py
```
```
python MAIN_user_cli_gpt.py # or MAIN_user_speech_reco.py
```
